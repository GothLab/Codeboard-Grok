## Overview
Grok helps developers create code-centric documentation and maps for development directly in the IDE. Build Grok Flows directly in your IDEÂ to better understand how your code interacts and development decisions. Grok helps developers onboard faster, navigate code more efficiently, share context and information, and pair on code with teammates.

### Getting Started
Search `Grok` in `Extensions` and click `Install`. Grok will automatically open in your side window. Grok works best when it is opened next to a code editor window (see example below). If you want to view documentation, click the gear icon in the top right and select `Open Help Doc`.

## How Developers Use Grok

### Store context and information in Flows

- Track code ranges, files, and context with specialized Flow cells.

- Create flexible diagrams to explain architectures and decisions

- Add media attachments-screenshots, UI renders, bug gifs-for context.

### Navigate and understand code faster

- Navigating through code in a Flow takes you to the locations referenced in the codebase.

- Draw edges between code, markdown, and media cells to understand how they relate.

- Trace how selected code snippets are related to other code snippets and annotations.

### Share and collaborate with teammates

- Save Flows to your Repo to create a record of your code and thoughts and to help answer questions, explain a thought process, or store important context for your team.

- Commit Flows as `.grok.json`  files with your PRs. Any teammate can pull, load, and edit a Flow that is saved to the repo your team is working on. Collaborating on Flows on top of Git enables relevant context versioning for the team. 

## Save hours every week for you and your team using Grok

Grok removes inefficiencies in daily development for individuals and teams. Grok "Flows" let developers track context and information while coding that can then be shared or reviewed when context switching.

Use Grok to: 

- Record code context: Context switching is painful. Using Grok Flows shortens ramp up time by letting developers track context and thoughts alongside code during development.

- Understand code relationships: Codebases get complex and overwhelming. Grok let developers  track and organize relevant files and code snippets for the task they're working on.

- Share info with teammates: Reduce duplicate work. Architecture diagrams, explanations, and general notes made in a Grok Flow can be easily exported and shared with a teammate.

- Improve code tracing: Flows help developers trace code and visualize relationships. Flows are stored alongside code in the Grok sidebar within the IDE and are easily traversed.

- Create code diagrams in the IDE: Tie general annotations and thoughts directly to the code blocks they concern. Draw edges on Graph Flows to connect code blocks, files, or thoughts.

- Onboard faster onto codebases: Reviewing teammate's Flows in Grok helps developers ramp up on a codebase or understand a decision, drastically reducing time to productivity.

### Data Privacy and Security
Grok does not interact with the cloud or any servers. No Flow or user information ever leaves your local system. All Grok Flows are saved to your Repo and loaded directly from your repo. Grok is provided to the VSCode marketplace "as is." The creators of Grok cannot be held responsible or liable in any way for how a user interacts with the Grok system. By downloading Grok, you acknowledge the above privacy and security statements and recognize you hold sole responsibility for any actions you take using Grok.
